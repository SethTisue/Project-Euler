Solve it yourself first!

## Scala

This is the language I've done my serious solving in.

## Haskell

Some solutions ported from Scala.

## NetLogo

These solutions were written for NetLogo 4.1.  NetLogo 5.0 has tasks (aka lambda, closures, first-class functions) now, so probably some of these solutions could be redone to use that, and tackling the more advanced problems would be more feasible.

## Clojure

I hardly know any Clojure yet.

## License

I, Seth Tisue, place everything in this repository in the public domain. Steal at will.
