Solve it yourself first!

## Scala

This is the language I've done my serious solving in.

Type `./sbt` to start sbt, then enter `test` at the sbt prompt.  (Run `ensime generate` if you want to use ENSIME.)

## Haskell

Some solutions ported from Scala.

Build and run using `cd haskell` followed by `make`.

## NetLogo

These solutions were originally written for NetLogo 4.1 and have been only lightly updated for 5.0.  NetLogo 5.0 has tasks (aka lambda, closures, first-class functions) now, so probably some of these solutions could be redone to use that, and tackling the more advanced problems would be more feasible.
