Solve it yourself first!

## Scala

This is the language I've done my serious solving in.

Build and run using xsbt (experimental sbt) 0.10.  Type `bin/xsbt` to start sbt, then enter `test` at the sbt prompt.

## Haskell

Some solutions ported from Scala.

Build and run using make.

## NetLogo

These solutions were originally written for NetLogo 4.1 and have been only lightly updated for 5.0.  NetLogo 5.0 has tasks (aka lambda, closures, first-class functions) now, so probably some of these solutions could be redone to use that, and tackling the more advanced problems would be more feasible.

## Clojure

I hardly know any Clojure yet.
