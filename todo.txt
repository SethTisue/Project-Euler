BigDecimal is improved in 2.8, maybe the code here that uses it could be improved

HEY! maybe I should be using a generic memoization package instead of rolling my own,
e.g. problem 14

when I'm factorizing a lot I should probably be caching the factorizations so for example once
I figure out 360 is divisible by 2, I can just cons 2 onto my cached answer for 180
