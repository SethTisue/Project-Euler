// Using a 6K text file containing a network with forty vertices, and given in matrix form, find the
// maximum saving which can be achieved by removing redundant edges whilst ensuring that the network

// I chose to optimize for simple (and pure-functional) code here and be relatively careless about
// efficiency.  The reverse-delete algorithm is the easiest to understand of the
// minimum-spanning-tree algorithms, I think.  I did include one optimization, using "throw" for
// early exit from pathExists.  The whole thing runs in about 1 second.
